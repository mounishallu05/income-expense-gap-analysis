# US Income vs. Living Expenses Analysis

## Problem Statement
Inflation is eroding the purchasing power of the everyday American. We hypothesize that median annual salaries are not increasing at the same rate as average living expenses. This project analyzes US income and annual household expense data at the metropolitan area and state levels to identify trends and understand the true extent of the gap. Additionally, we examine whether the recent mass exodus from larger metropolitan areas to smaller cities has caused spikes in rent prices.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, analysis, and modeling
- `results/`: Output visualizations and analysis results
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Data Sources
- US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) - Consumer Expenditure Survey
- US Census Bureau - American Community Survey (ACS)
- Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) - Regional Economic Data
- US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - Fair Market Rent data
- United States Postal Service (USPS) - Change of Address data

## Key Research Questions
1. How has the gap between median salaries and living expenses changed over time?
2. Which metropolitan areas show the largest disparities?
3. Is there evidence supporting a correlation between migration patterns and rent price increases?
4. Can we predict future cost-of-living trends based on migration patterns?
